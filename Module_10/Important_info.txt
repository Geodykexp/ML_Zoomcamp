What’s happening
Your subscription-service is of type LoadBalancer.

In cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), Kubernetes provisions an external load balancer and assigns an EXTERNAL-IP.

But in kind (local Kubernetes), there is no cloud load balancer, so the EXTERNAL-IP stays <pending>.

That’s why you can’t reach your service externally.

✅ Fix for kind
Since you’re running on kind, you should use NodePort or port-forwarding, not LoadBalancer.

Edit your service.yaml to use NodePort:

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: subscription-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: subscription
  ports:
    - port: 9696        # service port
      targetPort: 9696  # container port
      nodePort: 30000   # external port (between 30000–32767)
Apply the change:

bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
Check services again:

bash
kubectl get svc
You should now see:

Code
NAME                   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
subscription-service   NodePort   10.96.xxx.xxx  <none>        9696:30000/TCP   1m
Access your app:

Either via NodePort:

bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"year":2010,"mileage":100000,"make":"ford","model":"fusion"}' \
  http://localhost:30000/predict
Or via port-forward:

bash
kubectl port-forward service/subscription-service 8080:9696
Then test at http://localhost:8080/predict.

⚡ Summary:

LoadBalancer won’t work in kind → switch to NodePort or use port-forward.

Once you do this, you’ll be able to hit your prediction endpoint locally.

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to simulate CPU load so your HPA can actually scale the subscription deployment up to multiple Pods?
